### I'm working on

* Adding eslint rules using [eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y) to Sprout Social's web app repository as warnings and flipping them to errors once they are resolved.
* Added helper functions using [jest-axe](https://github.com/nickcolley/jest-axe) so we can include accessibility in our unit tests.
* Teaching my fellow web coworkers more about accessibility and making sure our design system is built with accessibility baked in from the beginning.
* Learning [react-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) - I really like how accessibility is built in, such as that you can query by label id and test the application as a user would use it.

### I'm keeping my eye on

* [Ryan Florence's ReachUI Components](https://ui.reach.tech/) - he's building common React components with accessibility in mind

### Some articles and media I'm thinking about

* [Eric Bailey's article on the prefers-reduced-motion media query](https://css-tricks.com/revisiting-prefers-reduced-motion-the-reduced-motion-media-query/)
* [WebAIM's Recent 1,000,000 Websites Report](https://webaim.org/projects/million/)
* [Nic Steenhout's A11y Podcast](https://a11yrules.com/)
