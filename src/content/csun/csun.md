### CSS Should Not Be Used for Content

-   Disconnect between the reading order and the visual order
-   `display: none` hides content from everyone
-   `::before`, `::after` pseudo classes used to add content
-   `position: absolute` - DOM disconnect
-   Different browser + AT combos handle differently
