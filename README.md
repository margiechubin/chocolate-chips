I generated this website with a gatsby starter and I am filling it in with my json file!

Instructions:

`npm install`

`gatsby develop`

Site runs at `http://localhost:8000`

graphQL queries can be run at `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`

TODOs:

1. resume
2. styles & typography & icons
3. deploy & publish - netlify?
4. [Dark mode](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-dark-mode/?=theme)
5. blog post next and previous
