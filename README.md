My website, built with GatsbyJS.

Instructions:

`npm install` to install all dependencies

`gatsby develop` to run the site locally

Site runs at `http://localhost:8000`

graphQL queries can be run at `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`

To deploy, push a commit to the `master` branch and Netlify will handle the rest!

Some other items I might implement
1. display resume?
2. Contact me page needs work!
3. Try [Dark mode](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-dark-mode/?=theme)
4. Blog post next and previous
