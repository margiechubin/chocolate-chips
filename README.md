I generated this website with a gatsby starter and I am filling it in with my json file!

Instructions:

`npm install`

`gatsby develop`

Site runs at `http://localhost:8000`

graphQL queries can be run at `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`

To deploy, push a commit and Netlify will handle the rest!

This site is still in it's early stages, so these are a few tasks I like to complete at some point
1. display resume? LinkedIn is more up to date
2. Styles & typography & icons
3. Contact me page needs work!
4. Implement [Dark mode](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-dark-mode/?=theme) - I'm a huge fan of dark mode
5. blog post next and previous
